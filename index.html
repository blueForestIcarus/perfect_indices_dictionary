This dictionary defines terms for "numbers" that are both cardinal and ordinal, in that they refer both to a location in a group, and the size of the group. Since these numbers can provide both a positive index (from the start of the list) and negative index (from the tail), we refer them as perfect indices. 

Perfect indices of rank N, postive index I, and negative index P should be read as:
    "Ith (Pth to last), out of N"

English has words both for cardinal numbers (one, two, three) and ordinal numbers (first, second, third, fourth). This site defines analogous terms for all perfect indices. The terms are defined algorithmically and can be defined for arbitrarily large numbers, and are intended to be pronouncable under normal english phonetic rules(though this is questionable). With a little memorization and an affinity for base 18, one could even learn to pick out the numbers without the aid of a computer, though god knows why you would want to do that.
